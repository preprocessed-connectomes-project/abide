abstract = {Functional brain networks are well described and estimated from data with Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs), e.g. using sparse inverse covariance estimators. Comparing functional connectivity of subjects in two population calls for comparing these estimated GGMs. We study the problem of identifying differences in Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) known to have similar structure. We aim to characterize the uncertainty of differences with confidence intervals obtained using a para-metric distribution on parameters of a sparse estimator. Sparse penalties enable statistical guarantees and interpretable models even in high-dimensional and low-number-of-samples settings. Quantifying the uncertainty of the parameters selected by the sparse penalty is an important question in applications such as neuroimaging or bioinformatics. Indeed, selected variables can be interpreted to build theoretical understanding or to make therapeutic decisions. Characterizing the distributions of sparse regression models is inherently challenging since the penalties produce a biased estimator. Recent work has shown how one can invoke the sparsity assumptions to effectively remove the bias from a sparse estimator such as the lasso. These distributions can be used to give us confidence intervals on edges in GGMs, and by extension their differences. However, in the case of comparing GGMs, these estimators do not make use of any assumed joint structure among the GGMs. Inspired by priors from brain functional connectivity we focus on deriving the distribution of parameter differences under a joint penalty when parameters are known to be sparse in the difference. This leads us to introduce the debiased multi-task fused lasso. We show that we can debias and characterize the distribution in an efficient manner. We then go on to show how the debiased lasso and multi-task fused lasso can be used to obtain confidence intervals on edge differences in Gaussian graphical models. We validate the techniques proposed on a set of synthetic examples as well as neuro-imaging dataset created for the study of autism.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) encompasses a complex manifestation of symptoms that include deficits in social interaction and repetitive or stereotyped interests and behaviors. In keeping with the increasing recognition of the dimensional characteristics of ASD symptoms and the categorical nature of a diagnosis, we sought to delineate the neural mechanisms of ASD symptoms based on the functional connectivity of four known neural networks (i.e., default mode network, dorsal attention network, salience network, and executive control network).

METHODS: We leveraged an open data resource (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) providing resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data sets from 90 boys with ASD and 95 typically developing boys. This data set also included the Social Responsiveness Scale as a dimensional measure of ASD traits. Seed-based functional connectivity was paired with linear regression to identify functional connectivity abnormalities associated with categorical effects of ASD diagnosis, dimensional effects of ASD-like behaviors, and their interaction.

RESULTS: Our results revealed the existence of dimensional mechanisms of ASD uniquely affecting each network based on the presence of connectivity-behavioral relationships; these were independent of diagnostic category. However, we also found evidence of categorical differences (i.e., diagnostic group differences) in connectivity strength for each network as well as categorical differences in connectivity-behavioral relationships (i.e., diagnosis-by-behavior interactions), supporting the coexistence of categorical mechanisms of ASD.

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a hybrid model for ASD characterization that includes a combination of categorical and dimensional brain mechanisms and provide a novel understanding of the neural underpinnings of ASD.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach for automatic diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) among males using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). fMRI has the capability to identify any abnormal neural interactions that may be responsible for behavioral symptoms observed in ASD patients. In this paper, the regional homogeneity of the voxels in the 116 regions of the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas of the brain are used as features which result in a large set of 54837 features. Chi-square feature selection method is then used to identify the most significant features and only these features are then used for classification with a metacognitive radial basis function classifier. Since genetic studies have indicated that ASD manifests differently in males and females, a large scale study specific to males is highlighted here using the publicly available preprocessed fMRI dataset from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), unlike existing studies which are either smaller in scale or consider both males and females together. Among the males, it is shown here that the classification performance can be improved (by up to 10{\%}) by considering adults and adolescents separately. By using Chi-square algorithm the number of features was reduced drastically to lower than 200 in contrast to the thousands of features that have been used in recent studies.},

abstract = {A powerful new method is described called Knowledge based functional connectivity Enrichment Analysis (KEA) for interpreting resting state functional connectivity, using circuits that are functionally identified using search terms with the Neurosynth database. The method derives its power by focusing on neural circuits, sets of brain regions that share a common biological function, instead of trying to interpret single functional connectivity links. This provides a novel way of investigating how task- or function-related related networks have resting state functional connectivity differences in different psychiatric states, provides a new way to bridge the gap between task and resting-state functional networks, and potentially helps to identify brain networks that might be treated. The method was applied to interpreting functional connectivity differences in autism. Functional connectivity decreases at the network circuit level in 394 patients with autism compared with 473 controls were found in networks involving the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, middle temporal gyrus cortex, and the precuneus, in networks that are implicated in the sense of self, face processing, and theory of mind. The decreases were correlated with symptom severity.},

abstract={The dynamic organization of human brain functional networks can be revealed through resting-state fMRI. It is still an open question about how to determine the essential factors underlying the dynamic activity of human brain. In this study, we proposed the assumption that the dynamic activity of brain was companied with various involvements of latent active patterns (LAPs). We further supposed that LAPs were sparsely involved with different brain states. We modeled the assumptions by adopting a dictionary-learning framework. An online dictionary learning method was used to calculate the LAPs and the sparse loading parameters. Based on the results obtained from the resting-state fMRI dataset, we found some commonly represented LAPs that were involved with the default mode network, salience network and frontoparietal attention network. The sparse represented LAPs at each time point were related with the time-varying activity. LAPs provided a new viewpoint to mine the factors related with the dynamic organization of brain activity.},

abstract="Exploiting the wealth of imaging and non-imaging information for disease prediction tasks requires models capable of representing, at the same time, individual features as well as data associations between subjects from potentially large populations. Graphs provide a natural framework for such tasks, yet previous graph-based approaches focus on pairwise similarities without modelling the subjects' individual characteristics and features. On the other hand, relying solely on subject-specific imaging feature vectors fails to model the interaction and similarity between subjects, which can reduce performance. In this paper, we introduce the novel concept of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for brain analysis in populations, combining imaging and non-imaging data. We represent populations as a sparse graph where its vertices are associated with image-based feature vectors and the edges encode phenotypic information. This structure was used to train a GCN model on partially labelled graphs, aiming to infer the classes of unlabelled nodes from the node features and pairwise associations between subjects. We demonstrate the potential of the method on the challenging ADNI and ABIDE databases, as a proof of concept of the benefit from integrating contextual information in classification tasks. This has a clear impact on the quality of the predictions, leading to 69.5{\%} accuracy for ABIDE (outperforming the current state of the art of 66.8{\%}) and 77{\%} for ADNI for prediction of MCI conversion, significantly outperforming standard linear classifiers where only individual features are considered.",

In this work, we propose a novel metric learning method to evaluate distance between graphs that leverages the power of convolutional neural networks, while exploiting concepts from spectral graph theory to allow these operations on irregular graphs. We demonstrate the potential of our method in the field of connectomics, where neuronal pathways or functional connections between brain regions are commonly modelled as graphs. In this problem, the definition of an appropriate graph similarity function is critical to unveil patterns of disruptions associated with certain brain disorders. Experimental results on the ABIDE dataset show that our method can learn a graph similarity metric tailored for a clinical application, improving the performance of a simple k-nn classifier by 11.9{\%} compared to a traditional distance metric.",

    abstract = {Quality control of MRI is essential for excluding problematic acquisitions and avoiding bias in subsequent image processing and analysis. Visual inspection is subjective and impractical for large scale datasets. Although automated quality assessments have been demonstrated on single-site datasets, it is unclear that solutions can generalize to unseen data acquired at new sites. Here, we introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC), a tool for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally and as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site dataset (17 sites, N = 1102). We perform model selection evaluating different normalization and feature exclusion approaches aimed at maximizing across-site generalization and estimate an accuracy of 76%Â±13% on new sites, using leave-one-site-out cross-validation. We confirm that result on a held-out dataset (2 sites, N = 265) also obtaining a 76% accuracy. Even though the performance of the trained classifier is statistically above chance, we show that it is susceptible to site effects and unable to account for artifacts specific to new sites. MRIQC performs with high accuracy in intra-site prediction, but performance on unseen sites leaves space for improvement which might require more labeled data and new approaches to the between-site variability. Overcoming these limitations is crucial for a more objective quality assessment of neuroimaging data, and to enable the analysis of extremely large and multi-site samples.},

abstract = {Estimates of functional connectivity using resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) are acutely sensitive to artifacts and large scale nuisance variation. As a result much effort is dedicated to preprocessing rs-fMRI data and using diagnostic measures to identify bad scans. One such diagnostic measure is DVARS, the spatial root mean square of the data after temporal differencing. A limitation of DVARS however is the lack of concrete interpretation of the absolute values of DVARS, and finding a threshold to distinguish bad scans from good. In this work we describe a sum of squares decomposition of the entire 4D dataset that shows DVARS to be just one of three sources of variation we refer to as D-var (closely linked to DVARS), S-var and E-var. D-var and S-var partition the sum of squares at adjacent time points, while E-var accounts for edge effects; each can be used to make spatial and temporal summary diagnostic measures. Extending the partitioning to global (and non-global) signal leads to a rs-fMRI DSE table, which decomposes the total and global variability into fast (D-var), slow (S-var) and edge (E-var) components. We find expected values for each component under nominal models, showing how D-var (and thus DVARS) scales with overall variability and is diminished by temporal autocorrelation. Finally we propose a null sampling distribution for DVARS-squared and robust methods to estimate this null model, allowing computation of DVARS p-values. We propose that these diagnostic time series, images, p-values and DSE table will provide a succinct summary of the quality of a rs-fMRI dataset that will support comparisons of datasets over preprocessing steps and between subjects.}
